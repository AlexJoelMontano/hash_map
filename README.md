## FARM GAME UPDATE!

### Farm Manager Simulator
In the Farm Manager Simulator game you will use your CLI to manage your very own farm.
#### Objective
Try to earn as much money as possible by buying and selling crops. 
#### How to play:
You will be prompted by a menu that will ask if you want to view your crops, sell your crops, or buy crops.
Everytime you load the game it will generate how many crops you collected that day, then you can choose whether to buy more or sell. 
#### To end the game type: 'exit'
This game uses a HashMap to store crops in buckets and retrieve them using custom methods for the HashMap.
